                                Research is a fundemantal part of any design process. With out any project is doomed to failure. By understanding the user one is designing for one can better design a product that attends to their needs. 
                                <br/><br/>
                                The research process starts with identifying who the user is. Data is then collected to learn more about the user, their needs and the problems they might face. Based on that, research questions are defined. From there, one can start ideating, prototyping and testing the different design solutions.
                                <br/><br/>
                                Here you can find several research project I was involved in.

                        <p class="work-description">
                            Once a solution has been found, the prototyping phase starts, in which one can test the (different) solution(s) in a variety of ways depending on the end product. 
                            <br/><br/>
                            After creating the prototypes, they need to be tested with a sample of users represeting the end-user who will be using the product. This way, one can ensure the quality of the end product delivered, in terms of usability, efficiency and effectivness, thus saving time, money and effort for both the designer and the client.
                            <br/><br/>
                            The following page contains a number of prototyping projects.

                            Programming isn't all still and serious, it can be creative, playful and fun; way to use logic to create art; a way to express oneself. 
                            <br/><br/>
                            Understanding and knowing how to program and code is important for me as a UX designer as it helps with not only traslating design into functional products, but alos helps with understanding developers and the technical possibilities and limits they face which are important to condsider in the design phase.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Using Processing programming language I created a number creative sketchs. It was quite interesting to see how one can create amazing artworks using several lines of code.
